🌱 Carbon Footprint Estimator

AI-powered Image Recognition for Sustainable Choices

📌 Overview

Carbon Footprint Estimator is an AI-based system that helps users understand the environmental impact of their choices.
By simply uploading an image, the system:

Recognizes the object/activity

Estimates the associated carbon emissions

Suggests alternative sustainable options

Highlights potential savings & profit opportunities

This project aims to make climate-conscious decisions simple, interactive, and impactful.

🚨 Key Features

🖼 Image Recognition – Upload an image of food, product, or transport mode; AI identifies it.

🌍 Carbon Estimation – Calculates estimated emissions based on trusted global datasets.

🔄 Sustainable Alternatives – Recommends eco-friendly substitutes (e.g., plant-based food, renewable transport).

💰 Profit Turning – Shows cost savings and possible profit from switching to greener options.

📊 Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes carbon impact and suggested improvements.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js / Next.js (for UI & dashboard)

Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask/Django)

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for image classification

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

APIs & Datasets: EPA, IPCC, and global carbon footprint datasets

🚀 How It Works

Upload Image → User provides a photo (e.g., burger, plastic bottle, car).

AI Detection → System recognizes the item using trained ML models.

Carbon Calculation → Emissions are estimated based on lifecycle data.

Alternative Suggestions → System proposes eco-friendly alternatives.

Profit/Savings Insights → Displays cost/environmental benefit of switching.

📊 Example

Input: 🖼 Plastic Bottle

Output:

Estimated Emission: 82g CO₂e

Suggested Alternative: Reusable Metal Bottle

Profit Turning: Save $50/year + reduce 30kg CO₂e annually
